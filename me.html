    <h2 class="mb-4">Resume</h2>
    <p>Choosing a career in software development was a natural decision for me,
        I am particularly fascinated by how software can solve real-world problems and improve lives. For me, software
        development is not just about writing code; it's about thinking critically, designing efficient solutions, and
        continuously learning and adapting to new technologies. It’s this blend of logic, creativity, and continuous
        growth that fuels my enthusiasm for becoming a software developer</p>

                    hobbies for as long as I can remember
                    I firmly believe that art and coding are two sides of the same coin. Both require a creative
                    mindset, a clear vision, and the ability to bring ideas to reality . My experience as an artist
                    enhancess my approach to coding, allowing me to design more productively and aesthetically pleasing
                    user interfaces and think creatively when solving complex problems.
                    I am excited to continue learning and growing in this field, and I look forward to the challenges
                    and opportunities that lie ahead</p>
